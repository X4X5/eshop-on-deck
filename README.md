# Wii U/3DS eShop themes for Steam Deck
This brings the Wii U/3DS eShop themes to the Steam Deck. This is made for purely preservation.

I might also add other eShop themes as well once I'm done with this, and if we get any new ones when the new Nintendo console launches. For now, this is what I'll be doing lol



# Changes to the AudioLoader (as of 09/14/2024)
Music is no longer officially supported by the devs of AudioLoader. It hasn't gone away, as existing music will remain, but no future music will be allowed there. So, if you want new music, you'll have to make that package yourself or look for others who still make music on sites like these to add. And if you go that route, you'll have to manuall install them yourself, of which I have instructions below on how to do that. This repository will soon be where all of my submissions will go, as they were all taken down when they changed their policy. As for making new themes, I might do that again if I feel like it. But I would't hold your breath.

# So.. how do I install them?
Great question! And I'm here with an answer!
1. Turn on your Steam Deck and go to Desktop Mode
2. Go to your web browser of choice and [download the zip file of this repository](https://ibb.co/w4FMMS8) (or the repository you're looking at)
3. Unzip the file somewhere where you'll remember where it is, then go to that directory.
4. Now, the easiest way to go about doing this is to keep two tabs open. You can do this easily by putting your mouse over a folder directory (Home, for example), pressing right trigger, and then clicking the "Open in New Tab" button to do so. Do that.
5. In this new tab, go to /home/deck/homebrew/sounds. [It should look like this.](https://ibb.co/MDv2DbR)
6. Now, go back to your other tab, and drag and drop the folder of the theme you want to the other tab.
7. You've now installed the theme. Go back to Gaming Mode, and find your theme in the Audio Loader tab, and it'll be there!
